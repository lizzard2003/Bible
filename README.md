My Team enjoyed .. 

I enjoyed working with a partner on a single project, I feel as if i havent done something like this since highschool.. It was nice to brainstorm diffrent ways to do things and talk through our problems together. I think that made the peoject also so much easier because we were using two brains. If there was something I couldnt figure out we would work together to solve. 
I also learned throughout this project that a lot of these features are not as hard/ complex as i thought they were. I mean I get we are just doing some of the basics but It is so awsome to know what goes into making some of these cool features and definetly makes me enjoy backend a lot more.

My Team didnt enjoy .. 

I would have to say the thing I didnt enjoy was thinking up the app, it was fun at first but there a lot that goes into making something that helps people and something that is effective. I do nottt know what people need and that whole process makes me respect a lot of these creator, because that couldnt be me. 
Secondly, i hoped to be able to do more on the project, I am super excited and proud of the end result we have.. i just wished we had more time to realy learn and discover some new features !!..
